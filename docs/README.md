from the code or external sources.

## Writing docs

- **Integrate, don't append.** Find the doc that owns the subject and rewrite the part that is now wrong. The standard failure is finishing a task and adding a paragraph to the bottom of the closest-looking doc; ten tasks later the doc is a pile of paragraphs in discovery order. `custom-providers.md` is what that looks like.
- **Don't document logic.** Prose that restates code drifts from the code and loses. Write down what the code can't tell you: why something is shaped the way it is, the gotcha that cost an afternoon, conventions nothing enforces, constraints that span packages or versions. If a reader could get it in two minutes by opening the file, cut it.
- **One fact, one doc.** Every other mention is a link. If you are about to write the same paragraph in two docs, one of them is a link.
- **Respect the layers.** `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CLAUDE.md` name things and link out. Activity docs like `docs/qa.md` and `docs/testing.md` set the bar for a kind of work. Subject docs like `docs/unistyles.md` own one thing completely. A layer never re-explains the one below it.
- **One subject per doc.** If the subject doesn't fit in a sentence, split the doc. A section per provider, vendor, or platform is a table plus one worked example.
- **Delete.** Obsolete sections go. Prefer a `packages/app/src/thing.ts:120` reference over a pasted block.
- **New doc?** Add a row to the table above and link it from the docs that should send readers there.
- **Standing instructions stay cache-stable.** No timestamps, counters, or generated content in `CLAUDE.md`, `WORKSPACE_PROTOCOL.md`, or bundled skills — any byte change invalidates the shared prompt-cache prefix for every session that loads them.
- Code-level facts belong in comments next to the code, not here.

## Doc voice

Plain and short. Second person. State the rule, then the reason when the reason isn't obvious. Match the doc you're editing.

Do not:

- Write a sentence to land a point. "It's not X, it's Y", "That's not a Z, that's a W", and every other setup-and-punchline shape.
- Add a clause that only asserts importance: "and that matters", "which is what keeps it working", "this is critical".
- Use "honest", "robust", "seamless", "powerful", "simply", "just", "delightful".
- Restate something you already said, in different words, for emphasis.
- Hedge with "generally", "typically", or "you may want to" when the answer is "do this".
- Clear your throat: "It's worth noting that", "In order to", "This section covers".
